                <p class="lead">Welcome to Puurti. As the name suggests, it FULFILLS the information requirements of your organization. It makes your organization nimble and flexible to the changing environment.</p>
                
                <div class="quote-box">
                    <p>Your accountants might ask you to stick to the old accounting system, but to compete in the outside world you cannot wait for your accountants - you need instant information at your finger tips.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Philosophy Behind Puurti</h3>
                <p>You've heard the phrase "what gets measured gets done". But how well can you present that measurement to the management is the differentiator. Puurti has a flexible reporting engine that allows you to generate any reports you want and restrict the users who see the report.</p>

                <h3>Our Vision</h3>
                <p>Imagine a dashboard that tells the sales manager the revenue for the previous three months. Imagine an alert to the store manager that the lead time to procure a certain raw material has been exceeded and the stock has fallen below the minimum level. Imagine a solution that does all this and much more - a digital nervous system that is so sensitive that the manager is always aware of what is happening in the business.</p>
